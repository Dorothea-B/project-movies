# Project Movies

This was a team project focusing on using React Router. It was the first bootcamp assignment in which we built a multiple-page application and switched between route paths. We also learned how to style our pages using the styled-components library.

## The problem

We used API from themoviedb to fetch our list of movies, and another endpoint to fetch individual movie details. 
We created a function to map the movies and render individual "movie-cards" with info showing when hovering.

To push ourselves further we also implemented a like-function giving the user ability to "star" movies and filter for starred movies. This was challenging because we had to solve how to toggle the boolean value of true/false, how to make it target only one specific movie and passing in that information to the select dropdown in the header component, and preventing the star-button from redirecting to the movie's detail page.
